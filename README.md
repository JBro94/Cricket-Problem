# Cricket-Problem
In this repository I have coded the cricket jumping problem.  This is a good coding example to showcase the ability of a programming language. I initially went over how to do and code the problem with a professor of mine in MatLab and then I proceeded to recode in python. 


These codes are written in MatLab.  The cricket.m code loops through multiple crickets making 1000 jumps each.  With this information, we can visually represent the average distance jumped by a single cricket in a random direction.  The single cricket problem can showcase the idea of a single cricket making the 1000 jumps.
