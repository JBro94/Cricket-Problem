# Cricket-Problem
In this repository I have coded the cricket jumping problem.  This is a good coding example to showcase the ability of a programming language. I initially went over how to do and code the problem with a professor of mine in MatLab and then I proceeded to recode in python. 


This is the python file for the same problem.  In this code, initially we loop through 100 crickets each jumping 1000 times. The code's purpose is to calculate the average of the distance jumped for each cricket.
